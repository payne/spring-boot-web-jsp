Hoping to make a simple example that uses MySQL and runs in Tomcat.

Note the article says this can not run in a self-executing JAR because
of a known problem with Spring Boot.   

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-developing-web-applications

## So far
1. does not work with webapp-runner.jar
2. works fine with tomcat 9 :-)
